This is a project to study the basics of html, css and js using local/session storage (maybe API's to custom). Allowing the user add, edit and delete tasks and customize their profile pic and maybe some more.
This was initialy a any device project to study more about adaptative displays, but I change and is going to be focuse more in smartphones, trying to allow login with google and to study how to use figma.

Basically, is a big project to me. Let's try make it.

I think that my obj json is going to be like this:
{
   "username":"felipe",
   "email":"felipeStuart12@gmail.com",
   "keyWord":"Octopus",
   "nightmode":"true",
   "profilePic":"base64String",
    "tasks": {
      "taskItem": [
        {"title": "Less playtime", "description": "Lorem ipslum...", "active":"true"},
        {"title": "Play some chess", "description": "Lorem ipslum...", "active":"true"},
        {"title": "Do all tasks", "description": "Lorem ipslum...", "active":"false"},
      ]
    }
}
